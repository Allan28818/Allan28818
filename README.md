Hello I'm a eternal student and programming lover, I love create tools that can help anybody get your desired results. 
I think programming is a thing that can make you think more and can improve the world to a better place, 
and I want to be a person that can improve the world with knowledge, code and a lot of coffee <img src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/i/29203ec5-5d51-4ad5-b40a-d455302f4cca/d63qqlo-1d58172a-38fe-4d24-86b0-651364df34b6.gif" alt="☕" width="4%" height="4%"/>.

# Which is the motive that made you start programming? <img src="http://angelitomg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Terminal.png" alt="⁉" width="5%" height="5%"/>
Well, this is a long history, but I'll try to resume this. I'm a guy that loves too much study, I love study everything because I think the knowledge can change the people
and the world, but I felt that my knowledge wasn't enough to do this, and I always loved technology and know how the things works. So I met the progrmming, and I hated, because
there's a lot of code and things that nobody knows and it was too much difficult to me. But I realized that this was a challange, and I tryed it again and I started to like it,
after I started to love it and I'm programming since that day.
